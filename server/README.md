# scheduler-backend
A small project for simplifying scheduling meetings. Through google oauth2 this 
site retrieves all your meetings and creates a summery of when you are busy or 
not. If a friend wants to have a meeting with you, then just give them a link 
so that they themselves can see all your holes in your schedule.
